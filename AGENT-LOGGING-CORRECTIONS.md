# Agent Logging Corrections Applied

## Changes Made

Based on your feedback, I've corrected the agent logging implementation:

### 1. ✅ Hooks Configuration Location
**Before:** Used standalone `hooks.json` file
**After:** Uses `.claude/settings.json` (correct Claude Code format)

Hooks configuration now lives in `.claude/settings.json` per Claude Code documentation.

### 2. ✅ Agent Monitor as Script
**Before:** Created `/agent-monitor` slash command
**After:** Created `agent-monitor.sh` shell script

Users now run:
```bash
.claude/scripts/agent-monitor.sh [filter] [value]
```

Instead of a slash command. This is more appropriate for a monitoring tool.

## File Structure

### Created/Modified Files:

```
base-claude/
├── .claude/
│   ├── settings.json              ← Hook configuration (was hooks.json)
│   └── scripts/
│       ├── migrate-agent-logging.js
│       ├── log-agent-invocation.js
│       ├── log-agent-completion.js
│       └── agent-monitor.sh        ← New monitoring script
└── commands/
    └── cadi/
        └── setup/
            └── init-agent-logging.md
```

### Removed Files:
- `base-claude/.claude/hooks.json` → renamed to `settings.json`
- `base-claude/commands/cadi/monitoring/agent-monitor.md` → replaced with script

## Configuration Format

**`.claude/settings.json`:**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Task",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "node .claude/scripts/log-agent-invocation.js",
            "timeout": 5000
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "SubagentStop": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "node .claude/scripts/log-agent-completion.js",
            "timeout": 5000
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Initialize Agent Logging
```bash
/init-agent-logging
```

### View Agent Activity
```bash
# Recent activity (last 15)
.claude/scripts/agent-monitor.sh

# All invocations
.claude/scripts/agent-monitor.sh all

# Filter by agent type
.claude/scripts/agent-monitor.sh type Explore

# Filter by session
.claude/scripts/agent-monitor.sh session abc123

# Filter by feature
.claude/scripts/agent-monitor.sh feature user-auth
```

## Deployment

The corrected structure will be deployed when users re-run:

```bash
./init-claude-project.sh /path/to/project
```

This will:
1. Copy `.claude/settings.json` with hook configuration
2. Copy all scripts including `agent-monitor.sh`
3. Copy migration script and hook scripts
4. Preserve existing project database

Then users initialize agent logging:
```bash
cd /path/to/project
/init-agent-logging
```

## Updated Documentation

The following files have been updated to reflect these changes:

- ✅ `AGENT-LOGGING-DEPLOYMENT.md` - All references to hooks.json → settings.json
- ✅ `AGENT-LOGGING-DEPLOYMENT.md` - All references to /agent-monitor → agent-monitor.sh
- ✅ `docs/features/agent-logging.md` - Updated configuration and usage sections
- ✅ `base-claude/commands/cadi/setup/init-agent-logging.md` - Updated verification steps

## Testing

All components tested and verified:
- ✅ Migration script runs successfully (schema v6)
- ✅ Database tables created correctly
- ✅ settings.json in correct location
- ✅ agent-monitor.sh script is executable and functional
- ✅ Hook scripts have correct permissions

## Next Steps

Ready to deploy! The corrected structure follows Claude Code conventions:
1. Hooks configuration in `.claude/settings.json`
2. Monitoring via shell script (not slash command)
3. All scripts properly executable
4. Documentation updated throughout

Users can update their tracked projects by re-running the init script.
